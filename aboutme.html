      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Nick. I'm learning how to code in order to become a web developer or software engineer. My current home is Portland, Oregon but I developed my interest in computers while growing up in the swamps of Louisiana. My offline interests include beekeeping, welding, and restoring furniture.</p>
